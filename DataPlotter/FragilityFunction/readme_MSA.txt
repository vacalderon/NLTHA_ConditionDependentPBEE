This folder contains example calculations to demonstrate the use of fragility fitting functions for use with Multiple Stripes Analysis data. These calculations are based on the following paper:

Baker, J. W. (2013). “Efficient analytical fragility function fitting using dynamic structural analysis.” Earthquake Spectra, (in review).

The following files are included in this folder:

illustrate_msa_fits.m   -- the main script to run the demonstration analyses
fn_mle_pc.m				-- a function that performs fitting to MSA data using maximum likelihood optimization
fn_mle_pc_probit.m	 	-- a function that performs fitting to MSA data using probit regression
fn_sse_pc.m 			-- a function that performs fitting to MSA data using sum of squared errors optimization (provided for comparison calculations)
